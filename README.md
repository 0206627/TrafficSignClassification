# TrafficSignClassification
Classified traffic signs images using computer vision, deep learning and PyTorch. Used a German dataset and also created our own small Mexican dataset to test it with our own CNN and also trained it using transfer learning.

This Jupyter Notebook explains to the last detail how to implement your own project. Feel free to change our CNN and just play with some of the parameters. Also check out the fastai library which works wonders.
